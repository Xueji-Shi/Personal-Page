                <h2>Xueji Shi</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a civil engineering student with a strong interest in fluid-structure interaction problems and a passion for exploring the underlying theoretical mechanisms. In my free time, I enjoy working out and swimming. In the future, I look forward to exploring more sports, such as boxing and surfing, among others.</p>
